# Statistical Methods
1. Exploratory analysis statistics
	- statistical plotting 
	- aggregate calculations
2. Statistical tests
	- p-values, 
	- chi-squared tests,
	- t-tests,
	- ANOVA
3. Machine Learning Modelling
	- regression
	- classification
	- clustering method
4. Probability and statistical distributions
	- Gaussian
	- Poisson Distribution


##### Statistical methods and models used for predict future events and uncover hidden patterns in data.


# Mathematical Technique
1.	Geometry (for example, distance calculations like Euclidean distance)
2.	Discrete math (for calculating probabilities)
3.	Linear algebra (for neural networks and other machine learning methods)
4.	Calculus (for training/optimizing some models, especially neural networks)

##### Many of the more diï¬ƒcult aspects of these mathematical techniques are not required for doing the majority of data science
