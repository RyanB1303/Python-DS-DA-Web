# Specialization in Data Science
1.	Machine Learning
	- The machine learning ﬁeld is also moving toward "deployment," meaning the
	ability to deploy machine learning models at scale
2. Business Intelligence ( BI )
	- BI specialist will be able to utilize data science techniques like analytics and visualization, then communicate to an organization what business decisions should be made
3. Deep Learning
	- Deep learning and neural networks are almost synonymous; "deep learning" simply means using large neural networks. 
	- For almost all applications of neural networks in the modern world, the size of the network is large and deep. 
	- These models are often used for image recognition, speech recognition, language translation, and modeling other complex data
	- Many start-ups and companies need people who can create neural network models for image recognition applications
	- Simpler models, like linear regression or boosted tree models, can often be better than deep learning models for reasons including computational eﬃciency and explainability.
4. Data Engineering
	- Data engineering encompasses skills often used in the ﬁrst steps of the data science process. These are tasks like collecting, organizing, cleaning, and storing data in databases, and are the sorts of things that data scientists spend a large fraction of their time on.
	- Data engineers have skills in Linux and the command line
	- Data engineers are also able to deploy machine learning models at scale
	- Data Scientist should know basic data engineering skills, such as how to interact with diﬀerent databases through Python and how to manipulate and clean data
5. Big Data
	- Hadoop
	- Apache Spark
6. NLP
	- Using programming languages to understand human language as writing and speech
	- involves processing and modeling text data, often from social media or large amounts of text data 
	- Chatbots
	- Sentiment analysis
	- Topic modeling
7.	AI
	-  Pathfindings
	-  Robotics	
8.	Statistics
